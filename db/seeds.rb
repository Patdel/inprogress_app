  username: "Caprice",
  biography: "Caprice was born in Rio de Janeiro and grew up in favela Santa Marta where she learned to paint murals with local artists for a number of years. After traveling around the country during her teen years, she moved to Spain and later to Belgium where she participated in several art performances and collaborated with other artists in the creation of murals in poor neighborhoods. She has been exhibiting in galleries in solo shows as well as group show for the last ten years",
  artist_statement: "My work is a product of my search of identity in both physical as well as spiritual environments. Having been brought up in a poor area of Rio de Janeiro is something that I realize i could never escape and would not want to deny. The iconography that I use in my projects is, in part, the result of living in a country with immense social disparities, where the presence of poverty in all its forms cohabit with an explosion of celebratory human energy during carnival and during soccer matches.",
